<div><em>Lesson 1: The Basics of the Web and HTML</em></div>

<p>The World Wide Web is a collection of HTML documents. The browser on your computer makes requests to servers.
Servers are computers that host the files that make up the web. They communicate using HTTP, the main protocol of the web.
</p>

<p><b>HTML</b> stands for <em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em>. HTML consists of the <em>text</em> or content of the page, the <em> markup</em> or what it looks like/how it's arranged, <em>references</em> to other documents such as images or videos, and lastly <em>links</em> to other pages on the internet. For example, here is a link to the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/courses/all"> Udacity Course Catalog.</a></p>
  
<p>In Lesson 1 we learned a lot about different <em>tags</em> and their <em>attributes</em>. Tags are usually made up of opening and closing tags. <em>Void tags</em>, however, do not need a closing tag as they do not contain content. Examples of void tags include the < br >  tag. It's a good idea to make your closing tags as soon as you have typed your opening tags. If you forget, the computer won't know to fix your mistake and the webpage will not display correctly.</p>

<p>We also learned about the difference between <em>inline</em> and <em>block</em> elements. Inline elements are simply text elements, such as the img or br tags whereas block elements, such as the paragraph tag, make an invisible block around the content.</p>

The <em>span</em> and <em>div</em> tags are important because we can attach styles to them. The span tag is an inline element and the div tag is a block element.</p>

<div><b>The 5 Biggest Takeaways From This Lesson</b></div>

<p>1. A webpage is a text document written in HTML. Web browsers read these documents, interpret, and display them.</p>

<p>2. Coding is the language the computer understands</p>

<p>3. Computers are stupid. Programmers need to be exact with their language. A simple typo could prevent the webpage from displaying correctly or at all.</p>

<p>4. Programmers can not remember everything. It is okay to look up bits of code.</p>

<p>5. Basic HTML vocabulary, including tags and elements. </p>
